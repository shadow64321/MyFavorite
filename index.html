    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>I have alway been a fan of music the main genres I like are Metal(I like most types of metal but in perticular melodic death metal), K-pop. I also play two instruments, these are the Guitar and Violin. below are some photos of my favorite Guitarist and Violinist. I like music because its fun to play instruments and listening to music is highly enjoyable.</p>
